Hoisting
 - Accessing variables before declaration
 - Variables and functions declaration are moved to the top of the scope
 - the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes 
   are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution

 var a = 10;  ---- made to -----      var a;
                                      a = 10

Not defined vs undefined
Not exists     Exists but has no value

Types in JS
- Primitve - string,number,null,undefined,boolean,bigint   -- When copied gives real value
- Reference  -- (),{},[] -- All those values when copied don't pass the real value but instead they give a Reference    
                            of the real value

    var a = [1,2,3,4]
    var b = a;
    // causes reference transfer to b ,shallow copy


Arrays

    let arr = [1,2,3,4]
    arr.unshift(0)
    //[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] //adds value to the front

    arr.shift()  // removes from front
    // [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

    arr.splice(1,2)
    //removes start to end   --- [ 1, 4 ]

    arr.slice(1)  -- [4] 
    // slices that many values from front
